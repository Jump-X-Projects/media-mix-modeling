## Introduction

A well-organized file structure is fundamental to the successful development of the media mix modeling web app. It ensures smoother navigation and collaboration among developers while enhancing the project's maintainability and scalability. This structure supports the project’s objectives by facilitating seamless integration between the frontend and backend components. With a dynamic modeling environment and an interactive user experience through Streamlit, the app demands a meticulously crafted file structure to accommodate various data processing, machine learning models, and user interface layers.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

The chosen tech stack for the project includes Streamlit for the frontend interface, Python powering the backend, and multiple machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, and possibly Pyro or TensorFlow Probability for Bayesian Media Mix Modeling (BMMM). Pandas is employed for data manipulation. Streamlit's capabilities significantly influence our file structure, as it allows for rapid prototyping and deployment while integrating directly with Python scripts. The stack’s component selections shape the organization of files to ensure modularity and efficiency.

## Root Directory Structure

At the root level, the project directory includes several primary directories essential for the organization of code and resources. Key directories include:

*   **src/**: Contains all source code related to the frontend and backend.
*   **data/**: Used for temporary storage of user-uploaded datasets during processing.
*   **models/**: Houses pre-trained models and scripts related to machine learning tasks.
*   **config/**: This directory contains configuration files for managing environment variables and system setups.
*   **logs/**: Captures log files that monitor application processes and errors.
*   **tests/**: Keeps testing scripts to ensure code quality and reliability. Additionally, files such as `README.md` for documentation and `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies are crucial at the root level for quick setup and understanding of the project.

## Frontend File Structure

Our frontend leverages Streamlit, which influences a simplified folder organization focused on immediate deployment and functionality. Key elements include:

*   **pages/**: Contains scripts for each page of the Streamlit app, e.g., `home.py`, `data_upload.py`, `model_selection.py`.
*   **components/**: Houses reusable UI components and layouts required across multiple pages.
*   **assets/**: Contains any static files required such as images, stylesheets (CSS), or any front-end related assets. This setup supports modularity, allowing developers to focus on individual page functionalities and easily integrate new features or updates.

## Backend File Structure

Python scripts and machine learning models are organized to ensure efficient data processing and model management:

*   **api/**: Handles all API routing for data input and output, encapsulating the communication logic.
*   **controllers/**: Scripts that direct the flow of data and application logic, interfacing between the models and views.
*   **services/**: Holds business logic and service scripts specific to analyzing and predicting revenue.
*   **models/**: Contains scripts or libraries dedicated to machine learning tasks, including model training and selection. This detailed structure enhances maintainability, allowing individual components to be updated independently.

## Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration files play a critical role in the app by defining settings and environment-specific variables. These include:

*   **.env**: Holds environment variables crucial for distinguishing between production and development settings.
*   **config.yaml**: Used for storing application-specific settings, paths, and keys.
*   **requirements.txt**: Lists all Python package dependencies needed to run the app efficiently. Such files ensure uniform setup across development environments and streamline deployment processes.

## Testing and Documentation Structure

The organization of testing and documentation is pivotal to the project's success:

*   **tests/**: Contains unit and integration test scripts, facilitating continuous testing and quality assurance.
*   **docs/**: Includes API documentation, technical guides, and user manuals, contributing to internal knowledge sharing and external support.
*   **logs/**: Maintains operation logs, helping in debugging and performance monitoring. This structure empowers developers to ensure code integrity and maintain clear communication across the team.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

The outlined file structure is designed to support the dynamic nature of this media mix modeling web app, accommodating both rapid development and future scalability. By separating frontend and backend components, structuring machine learning models, and clearly defining configuration management, the organization paves the way for efficient collaboration. Unique features of this setup, influenced by the integration of Streamlit and sophisticated modeling libraries, differentiate this project by offering both intuitiveness for developers and users alike.
