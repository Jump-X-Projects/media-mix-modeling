### Introduction

System prompts play an essential role in guiding AI behavior and interactions within applications. In the context of our media mix modeling web application developed using Streamlit, these prompts are pivotal in ensuring that AI systems perform tasks accurately and provide useful insights to users. The application is designed to analyze the relationship between media spending by channel and total daily revenue, offering predictive insights through advanced modeling techniques. Understanding the system prompts is crucial for anyone involved in the development or maintenance of the application, as they dictate the AI's functionality and response patterns.

### Purpose of System Prompts

The primary purpose of system prompts is to shape the interactions between users and the AI system, ensuring that the AI's responses are relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate. Prompts help the AI understand the specific tasks it needs to perform, from processing data uploads to generating predictive analytics. Effective prompts are characterized by clarity and specificity, reducing the likelihood of errors and improving the overall user experience by delivering timely and precise information.

### Prompt Structure and Guidelines

System prompts in our application follow a structured format to maintain consistency and ensure clarity. Each prompt includes specific language conventions that the AI uses to interpret and execute tasks. Prompts should be concise and directly related to the AI’s tasks, avoiding ambiguous language. The prompts must also be relevant to the current user interaction, ensuring that the AI can provide accurate and pertinent responses.

### Core System Prompts

Core system prompts are integral to the application’s functionality and include directives for uploading and validating data, selecting predictive models, and displaying analysis results. For instance, a prompt might instruct the AI to "check for data integrity and confirm file format upon CSV/XLS upload." Another important prompt could direct the AI to "present model selection options, including BMMM, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Meta Robyn." These core prompts are used consistently across different scenarios to ensure uniform application behavior and user-friendly interactions.

### Role-Specific Prompts

Role-specific prompts tailor the AI’s behavior depending on the user's task at hand. For instance, when acting as a data processor, the AI might prompt users to "upload financial data for analysis," while as an analytical engine, it might instruct on "executing model computations and visualizing feature importance." These prompts guide the AI to provide context-specific assistance, aligning its interactions with user requirements.

### Dynamic Prompts

Dynamic prompts are those that adapt based on user input or context, allowing the AI to respond to different scenarios flexibly. For example, if a user submits a specific data set, a dynamic prompt might initiate "customized revenue prediction based on new data inputs." These prompts are designed to adjust their content based on the evolving context, providing personalized responses and enhancing user engagement.

### Error Handling Prompts

Error handling prompts are essential for maintaining a smooth user experience, particularly when the AI encounters data inconsistencies or computational errors. These prompts might include instructions like "prompt user to re-upload data if format validation fails" or "notify user of invalid entries and suggest corrections." By guiding the AI through these scenarios, the application can handle errors gracefully and continue providing valuable insights without significant disruptions.

### Feedback and Improvement

User feedback is crucial in enhancing the quality and effectiveness of system prompts. The application will incorporate mechanisms for gathering user feedback on AI interactions, focusing on prompt clarity and utility. This feedback will be systematically reviewed and used to refine and optimize prompts, ensuring that the AI remains accurate and user-friendly as it adapts to user needs and technological advancements.

### Conclusion and Overall Summary

System prompts are foundational to the effective functioning of our media mix modeling web application. They ensure that AI interactions are well-directed, accurate, and beneficial to the users. By understanding the structure and purpose of these prompts, stakeholders can appreciate their role in enhancing the application's usability and effectiveness. The thoughtful design and continuous improvement of these prompts are what set this project apart, ensuring that users receive precise insights and a seamless experience when analyzing their media spend data.
