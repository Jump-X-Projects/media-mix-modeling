# Cursor Rules for Project

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Media Mix Modeling Web App

**Description:** This web application is designed to analyze and predict the relationship between media spend by channel and total daily revenue. Users can upload data files containing daily media spend for various channels, such as Google and Facebook, along with revenue data, and choose from a variety of predictive models to map these relations.

**Tech Stack:**

*   **Frontend:** Streamlit for main web interface
*   **Backend:** Python
*   **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, Pyro or TensorFlow Probability
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas

**Key Features:**

*   Upload interface supporting CSV and XLS formats
*   Model selection interface (BMMM, LightGBM, XGBoost, Meta Robyn)
*   Analysis output features (feature importance, correlation matrix)
*   Revenue prediction and spend suggestion modules
*   Model performance evaluation metrics (R-squared, RMSE, etc.)

## Project Structure

### Root Directory:

Contains the main configuration files and documentation.

### /frontend:

Contains all frontend-related code, including components, styles, and assets.

*   **/components:** Main UI components rendered via Streamlit.
*   **/assets:** Static files such as logos and images.
*   **/styles:** CSS files or Streamlit themes for styling the app.

### /backend:

Contains all backend-related code, including API routes and database models.

*   **/controllers:** Python scripts handling requests and processing data.
*   **/models:** Machine learning models and data processing scripts.
*   **/routes:** Definitions for different app navigation flows.
*   **/config:** Configuration files for environment variables and settings.

### /tests:

Contains unit and integration tests for both frontend and backend.

## Development Guidelines

*   **Coding Standards:** Use PEP8 for Python code style; ensure readability and maintainability.
*   **Component Organization:** Components should be modular, focusing on specific functionalities like data upload or model display.

## Cursor IDE Integration

*   **Setup Instructions:**

    1.  Install Streamlit and required Python libraries.
    2.  Set up a virtual environment.
    3.  Use Cursor IDE to open the project, configuring Python as the main language.

*   **Key Commands:**

    *   `streamlit run app.py` to start the main application.

## Additional Context

*   **User Roles:** Current phase doesnâ€™t include user authentication; the app will be primarily for internal team use.
*   **Accessibility Considerations:** Ensure interface elements are actionable and clear, drawing inspiration from tools like Tableau for ease of data navigation.
