### Introduction

This document outlines the technology stack for a media mix modeling web app developed to analyze and predict the impact of media spending across various advertising channels, like Google, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and others, on daily revenue. The application allows users to upload data files and select from multiple predictive models, providing features like revenue prediction and spend optimization. The primary goal of the chosen technologies is to ensure a seamless user experience and accurate data analysis while facilitating easy deployment and integration.

### Frontend Technologies

The frontend of the application is built using Streamlit, an open-source framework for building web applications in Python. Streamlit was chosen because it allows us to rapidly develop and deploy interactive web interfaces that are both intuitive and visually appealing. With Streamlit, users can easily upload their data files and navigate through the app's various modules, enhancing their engagement with the platform. The framework supports easy integration of data visualizations, making it ideal for displaying complex analytical outputs such as feature importance and correlation matrices.

### Backend Technologies

On the backend, the app utilizes Python, a versatile and widely used programming language, for data processing and model implementation. Python's extensive library ecosystem helps manage different aspects of data handling and analysis. Key machine learning libraries used include scikit-learn for general machine learning tasks, LightGBM and XGBoost for gradient boosting tasks, and potentially Pyro or TensorFlow Probability for implementing Bayesian Media Mix Modeling (BMMM). Pandas is employed for efficient data manipulation, allowing easy handling of the datasets uploaded by users. These components work together to perform rigorous data analysis, support model selection, and generate reliable prediction outputs.

### Infrastructure and Deployment

The app is primarily deployed using Streamlit's sharing platform, which facilitates easy deployment and sharing of interactive applications. Streamlitâ€™s deployment platform makes the app readily accessible to users without complex setup or configuration needed on their part. For version control, Git is utilized, enabling robust tracking of code changes and easy collaboration among development team members. The option to scale to larger cloud environments in the future ensures the app can handle increased demand or larger datasets as needed.

### Third-Party Integrations

Currently, the app does not integrate with specific third-party services or APIs, as the primary focus is on internal analysis and predictions. However, the use of external machine learning libraries like Meta Robyn indicates potential for more extensive integrations if the app's scope expands. The choice to limit third-party integrations initially helps streamline development and focus on core functionalities.

### Security and Performance Considerations

Security measures include using HTTPS to encrypt data transmissions, ensuring that data remains secure from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks during upload and processing. Uploaded files are stored temporarily and deleted after the session ends to protect user privacy. The app is optimized to handle datasets up to 5000 rows efficiently, ensuring responsive performance during analysis and predictive operations. Such considerations are crucial to maintaining user trust and satisfaction.

### Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

The chosen technology stack for the media mix modeling app emphasizes streamlined data processing and user interaction while allowing flexibility for future growth. The combination of Streamlit, Python, and robust machine learning libraries provides a solid foundation for accurate media spend analysis and revenue prediction. This tech stack not only meets current project needs but also positions the app for potential expansion, ensuring it remains a valuable tool for data-driven marketing decision-making.
