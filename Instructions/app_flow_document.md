### Introduction

The Media Mix Modeling web application is crafted to offer users the capability to analyze and predict how media spending across various advertising channels influences daily revenue. By uploading their data and leveraging different predictive models, users can understand the effects of their marketing investments on revenue growth. This application primarily targets businesses that aim to optimize their media budgets across platforms like Google, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. The critical context here involves the absence of user authentication, as internal teams will initially use the app.

### Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Currently, onboarding primarily involves users accessing the app through a direct link, as there is no sign-in or sign-up required due to its internal team usage design. Once the link is accessed, users immediately land on the home screen. Password recovery, social login, and other authentication-related features are unnecessary at this stage.

### Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon accessing the app, users are greeted by the Home Screen. This page provides an introduction to the app's functionalities, ensuring that users understand the navigation flow. The main navigation menu, typically available as a sidebar in Streamlit, allows users to move seamlessly between different modules, such as Data Upload, Model Selection, and Analysis Results.

### Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The user's journey begins with the Data Upload Module, where they can upload their CSV or XLS files containing media spend and revenue data. The app performs initial data cleaning and validation to ensure only quality data enters the analytical models. After successful upload and data verification, users proceed to the Model Selection Page. Here, they can choose from multiple models like Bayesian Media Mix Modeling, LightGBM, XGBoost, or Meta Robyn depending on their analytical needs.

Following the selection of a model, users are directed to the Analysis Results page. This page showcases various insights, including feature importance and a correlation matrix that visualizes the relationship between different media channels and revenue. For deeper analysis, users continue to the Revenue Predictor Module, allowing them to input hypothetical media spends and generate revenue forecasts. The journey extends to the Spend Optimizer Module, which provides recommendations for media spending allocations to meet specific revenue targets.

A Model Performance Dashboard is available to supply users with feedback and insights on the selected model's accuracy and performance. This includes metrics such as R-squared, RMSE, MAPE, and p-values for statistical significance, ensuring users can entrust the generated insights.

### Settings and Account Management

Although user account management and personalization settings are non-existent due to the app's initial scope being limited to internal teams, future iterations could consider these for broader exposure and personalization.

### Error States and Alternate Paths

Error handling is an integral component, particularly during data upload stages. If a user attempts to upload a file with unsupported formats or errors in data configuration, clear error messages appear. These guide users on correcting their files for a successful upload. If the app encounters connectivity issues or restricted actions, streamlined fallback pages encourage users to retry or guide them to informative sections that explain potential issues.

### Conclusion and Overall App Journey

In conclusion, users experience a straightforward journey from data upload to deriving actionable insights through advanced media mix models. By seamlessly moving through modules like the Model Selector and Analysis Results with an intuitive interface inspired by top-tier data analysis tools, users can make informed marketing decisions. Without the need for complex authentication or unnecessary data storage, the app remains accessible and focused on delivering efficient analytical solutions, helping businesses realize their marketing potential and maximize revenue impact.
